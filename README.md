# Santander-Customer-Satisfaction

Santander Customer data provided by the Santander Bank is pre-processed.

Two approaches are implemented:-
1. Analysis on balanced dataset - obtained by undersampling the original dataset.

2. Analysis on unbalanced dataset - using entire dataset for analysis

Machine Learning Classification Algorithms such as Random Forest and XG Boost are used.

The models developed are subjected to hyperparameter tuning using Randomized Search Cross Validation and the results are obtained.
